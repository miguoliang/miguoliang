Hey! 👋 I'm Mi Guoliang.

I'm a full-stack software programmer. I can write applications for platforms like AWS Cloud, Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Linux. I am also a software architect in a company that provides tools for code quality and vulnerable analysis. I spend much time optimizing the development process to reduce the time cost for my team at work. I recently became enthusiastic about Rust because of its memory safety and high performance.
